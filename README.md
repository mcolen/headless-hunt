# headless-hunt
A chrome extension to shrink or remove the header on
https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords.

## Legacy Header
The extension will replace the newer, large header with a smaller, legacy header
on all URL paths starting with `crosswords` or `puzzles` and served from
`www.nytimes.com`.

## Hide Header
The extension can also hide the header entirely. Trigger the page action either
by clicking on the extension icon in Chrome's toolbar, or by invoking the
assigned keyboard shortcut. By default, the keyboard shortcut is Ctrl + Shift +
H (Command + Shift + H on Mac).
